# ðŸ“š Kurumi [![Build Status](<https://ci.danielraybone.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:Notes_Build)/statusIcon>)](https://ci.danielraybone.com/buildConfiguration/Notes_Build?mode=branches&guest=1)

A simple note taking web app built with NextJS, Monaco (VSCode Editor) and MongoDB.

## Development

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Start dev server

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

Build files

```
yarn build
```

Start NextJS server

```
yarn start
```

### SSL

For SSL support, you will need a webserver to reverse proxy the application. Any webserver can be used, a basic Nginx
configuration is below:

```nginx
upstream notes {
        server localhost:3000;
}

server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
        server_name notes.example.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.key;
        ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/origin_ca_rsa_root.pem;

        location / {
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_pass http://notes;
        }
}
```
